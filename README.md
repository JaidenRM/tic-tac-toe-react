# Welcome!
This project will be a small project where I'll create a simple game of Tic Tac Toe using React and Co.

## Get it up and running
 * Simply clone the repo and run something like `npm install` to get all the dependencies for the project.
 * Once that's done, you can type in `yarn start` to spin up the project on your local.
 * May the odds be ever in your favour.

### File explanations
 * `settings.json` and `.prettierrc.json` are there to configure Prettier
 * `eslintrc.js` is for ESLint configuration; influenced by airbnb style guide
